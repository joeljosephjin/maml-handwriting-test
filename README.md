# MAML Handwriting Test

Experiments on few shot MAML classification with a bunch of handwritten digits. Using the [Learn2Learn](https://github.com/learnables/learn2learn) Package for Meta-Learning.

```Meta Omniglot with MAML.ipynb``` - contains code to train a MAML model on the Omniglot Dataset and save the model onto a file.

```[Testing] Meta Omniglot with MAML.ipynb``` - Tests the meta-trained model on 15 handwritten digits (1 to 5).
